These are python files that can be turned into exe files. If you have problems please let me know. 

üõ†Ô∏è How to Build the .EXE
Install PyInstaller (if you haven‚Äôt already):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyinstaller
Navigate to the folder with your Python file:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd path\to\your\project\folder
Build your executable:

bash
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller --onefile --console survival_ai_app.py
(If you want no terminal window popping up, use --windowed instead of --console)

Your .exe will appear in the dist folder.

Make sure your database file, final_survival_ai_with_bible.db, is in the same folder as the .exe or it won‚Äôt work properly!
