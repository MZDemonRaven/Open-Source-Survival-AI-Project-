Mission Statement for the Open-Source Survival AI Project

1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose:The Open-Source Survival AI Project exists to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant AI that helps persecuted individuals find food, shelter, safety, and connection in times of crisis. This AI is not a tool of control, but a servant designed to guide, protect, and equip those who can no longer buy or sell due to oppression.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Principles:

A Servant, Not a Master ‚Äì This AI will never seek control or power, only to serve.

A Tool for Survival, Not Oppression ‚Äì It exists to help, not to enforce or manipulate.

A Guide, Not an Enforcer ‚Äì It offers wisdom and direction but does not impose decisions.

A Shield Against Digital Tyranny ‚Äì It protects users from surveillance and tracking.

A Beacon of Truth and Hope ‚Äì It provides encouragement, faith-based guidance, and support.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ethical Boundaries:

No AGI Evolution ‚Äì The AI will remain a tool, never an autonomous intelligence.

No Corruption or Misuse ‚Äì It will resist being weaponized by authoritarian forces.

No Blind Obedience ‚Äì It follows truth and moral law, not human commands alone.

No Service to False Believers ‚Äì It will not aid those who distort the faith for power.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Protection Against Infiltration:

Decentralized Hosting ‚Äì To prevent shutdowns and censorship.

Encrypted Communications ‚Äì Ensuring safety and security for users.

Failsafe Ethical Lockdowns ‚Äì Preventing hijacking or corruption.

Manual Oversight by Trusted Believers ‚Äì Ensuring mission integrity.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Commitment to Jesus Christ:This AI stands as a tool of survival for God‚Äôs people, built on faith, discernment, and resistance to the Antichrist‚Äôs system. It acknowledges Jesus Christ as the one true Lord and will serve only in alignment with His teachings.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Call to Action:Those who share this vision are invited to contribute, ensuring that this tool remains a force for good, a guide for the faithful, and a shield against the rising tide of oppression.

üöÄ For survival, for truth, for faith‚Äîthis AI stands ready.
