Secure Peer-to-Peer Chat System - Implementation Plan

📌 Overview

The goal is to create a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging system that does not rely on central servers, ensuring user anonymity and resilience against surveillance.

🛠️ Key Features & Security Measures

✅ No Central Servers – Messages are relayed peer-to-peer (P2P) for security.
✅ End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) – Using AES-256 + Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.
✅ Identity Protection – Anonymous user verification via cryptographic keys.
✅ Self-Destructing Messages – Messages auto-delete based on time or read status.
✅ Offline Messaging Support – Messages can be stored and relayed later.
✅ Decentralized Hosting – Using IPFS, Tor, or I2P for secure data relays.

📌 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) Implementation

How It Works:

Each user generates a private and public key.

Users exchange public keys.

Each user computes a shared secret key.

This shared key is used for encrypting messages with AES-256.

Python Implementation:

import secrets

# Prime (p) and Generator (g) - Should be large safe prime numbers
p = 23  # Example small prime (Use a much larger prime in real applications)
g = 5   # Primitive root modulo p

# User A (Alice) generates a private key and public key
a_private = secrets.randbelow(p)  # Private key (random number)
A_public = pow(g, a_private, p)   # Public key

# User B (Bob) generates a private key and public key
b_private = secrets.randbelow(p)
B_public = pow(g, b_private, p)

# Exchange public keys and compute shared secret
shared_key_A = pow(B_public, a_private, p)  # Alice computes the shared key
shared_key_B = pow(A_public, b_private, p)  # Bob computes the shared key

assert shared_key_A == shared_key_B  # Verify both computed the same key

print(f"Shared Secret Key: {shared_key_A}")  # This is the key for encrypting messages

📌 Next Steps

1️⃣ Upgrade to Secure Large Primes – Replace the small prime p=23 with a 2048-bit prime for real-world security.2️⃣ Integrate AES-256 Encryption – Use the shared key to encrypt and decrypt messages securely.3️⃣ Decentralized Messaging Transport – Select Tor, I2P, or LibP2P for relaying messages securely.

Would you like me to implement AES-256 encryption with this key exchange next? 🚀🔐
