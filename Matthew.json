It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,\n17\nAnd saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.\n18\nFor\nJohn\ncame neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.\n19\nThe Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.\n20\nThen began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:\n21\nWoe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee,\nBethsaida\n! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in\nTyre\nand\nSidon\n, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.\n22\nBut I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for\nTyre\nand\nSidon\nat the day of judgment, than for you.\n23\nAnd thou,\nCapernaum\n, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in\nSodom\n, it would have remained until this day.\n24\nBut I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of\nSodom\nin the day of judgment, than for thee.\n25\nAt that time\nJesus\nanswered and said,\nI thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\n26\nEven so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.\n27\nAll things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\n28\nCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n29\nTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n30\nFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China."

And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.\n11\nAnd he said unto them,\nWhat man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?\n12\nHow much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.\n13\nThen saith he to the man,\nStretch forth thine hand.\nAnd he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.\n14\nThen the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.\n15\nBut when\nJesus\nknew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;\n16\nAnd charged them that they should not make him known:\n17\nThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,\n18\nBehold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.\n19\nHe shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.\n20\nA bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.\n21\nAnd in his name shall the Gentiles trust.\n22\nThen was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.\n23\nAnd all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of\nDavid\n?\n24\nBut when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by\nBeelzebub\nthe prince of the devils.\n25\nAnd\nJesus\nknew their thoughts, and said unto them,\nEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:\n26\nAnd if\nSatan\ncast out\nSatan\n, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?\n27\nAnd if I by\nBeelzebub\ncast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.\n28\nBut if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.\n29\nOr else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.\n30\nHe that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\n31\nWherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.\n32\nAnd whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.\n33\nEither make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.\n34\nO generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\n35\nA good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.\n36\nBut I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\n37\nFor by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\n38\nThen certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.\n39\nBut he answered and said unto them,\nAn evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet\nJonas\n:\n40\nFor as\nJonas\nwas three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\n41\nThe men of\nNineveh\nshall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of\nJonas\n; and, behold, a greater than\nJonas\nis here.\n42\nThe queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of\nSolomon\n; and, behold, a greater than\nSolomon\nis here.\n43\nWhen the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.\n44\nThen he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.\n45\nThen goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

This is he which received seed by the way side.\n20\nBut he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;\n21\nYet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.\n22\nHe also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.\n23\nBut he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.\n24\nAnother parable put he forth unto them, saying,\nThe kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:\n25\nBut while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.\n26\nBut when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.\n27\nSo the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?\n28\nHe said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?\n29\nBut he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\n30\nLet both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.\n31\nAnother parable put he forth unto them, saying,\nThe kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:\n32\nWhich indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.\n33\nAnother parable spake he unto them;\nThe kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.\n34\nAll these things spake\nJesus\nunto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:\n35\nThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.\n36\nThen\nJesus\nsent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.\n37\nHe answered and said unto them,\nHe that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;\n38\nThe field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;\n39\nThe enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.\n40\nAs therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.\n41\nThe Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;\n42\nAnd shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n43\nThen shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n44\nAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\n45\nAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:\n46\nWho, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\n47\nAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:\n48\nWhich, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.\n49\nSo shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,\n50\nAnd shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n51\nJesus\nsaith unto them,\nHave ye understood all these things?\nThey say unto him, Yea, Lord.\n52\nThen said he unto them,\nTherefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.\n53\nAnd it came to pass, that when\nJesus\nhad finished these parables, he departed thence.\n54\nAnd when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?\n55\nIs not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called\nMary\n? and his brethren,\nJames\n, and\nJoses\n, and\nSimon\n, and\nJudas\n?\n56\nAnd his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?\n57\nAnd they were offended in him.

And he was speechless.\n13\nThen said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n14\nFor many are called, but few are chosen.\n15\nThen went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.\n16\nAnd they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.\n17\nTell us therefore, What thinkest thou?

for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.\n16\nWoe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!\n17\nYe fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?\n18\nAnd, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.\n19\nYe fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?\n20\nWhoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.\n21\nAnd whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.\n22\nAnd he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.\n23\nWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.\n24\nYe blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.\n25\nWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.\n26\nThou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.\n27\nWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!

and shall deceive many.\n6\nAnd ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.\n7\nFor nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\n8\nAll these are the beginning of sorrows.\n9\nThen shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.\n10\nAnd then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.\n11\nAnd many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.\n12\nAnd because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\n13\nBut he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\n14\nAnd this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\n15\nWhen ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by\nDaniel\nthe prophet, stand in the holy place,\n(whoso readeth, let him understand:)\n16\nThen let them which be in\nJudaea\nflee into the mountains:\n17\nLet him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:\n18\nNeither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.\n19\nAnd woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!\n20\nBut pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:\n21\nFor then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.\n22\nAnd except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.\n23\nThen if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is\nChrist\n, or there;

And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.\n16\nAnd from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.\n17\nNow the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to\nJesus\n, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?\n18\nAnd he said,\nGo into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.\n19\nAnd the disciples did as\nJesus\nhad appointed them; and they made ready the passover.\n20\nNow when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.\n21\nAnd as they did eat, he said,\nVerily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.\n22\nAnd they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?\n23\nAnd he answered and said,\nHe that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.\n24\nThe Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.\n25\nThen\nJudas\n, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?

Likewise also said all the disciples.\n36\nThen cometh\nJesus\nwith them unto a place called\nGethsemane\n, and saith unto the disciples,\nSit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.\n37\nAnd he took with him\nPeter\nand the two sons of\nZebedee\n, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.\n38\nThen saith he unto them,\nMy soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.\n39\nAnd he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying,\nO my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\n40\nAnd he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto\nPeter\n,\nWhat, could ye not watch with me one hour?\n41\nWatch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\n42\nHe went away again the second time, and prayed, saying,\nO my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.\n43\nAnd he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.\n44\nAnd he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.\n45\nThen cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them,\nSleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n46\nRise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.\n47\nAnd while he yet spake, lo,\nJudas\n, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.\n48\nNow he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.\n49\nAnd forthwith he came to\nJesus\n, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.\n50\nAnd\nJesus\nsaid unto him,\nFriend, wherefore art thou come?\nThen came they, and laid hands on\nJesus\n, and took him.\n51\nAnd, behold, one of them which were with\nJesus\nstretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.\n52\nThen said\nJesus\nunto him,\nPut up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\n53\nThinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?\n54\nBut how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?\n55\nIn that same hour said\nJesus\nto the multitudes,\nAre ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.\n56\nBut all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.\nThen all the disciples forsook him, and fled.\n57\nAnd they that had laid hold on\nJesus\nled him away to\nCaiaphas\nthe high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.\n58\nBut\nPeter\nfollowed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.\n59\nNow the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against\nJesus\n, to put him to death;\n60\nBut found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,\n61\nAnd said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.\n62\nAnd the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?\n63\nBut\nJesus\nheld his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the\nChrist\n, the Son of God.\n64\nJesus\nsaith unto him,\nThou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\n65\nThen the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.\n66\nWhat think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.\n67\nThen did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,\n68\nSaying, Prophesy unto us, thou\nChrist\n, Who is he that smote thee?\n69\nNow\nPeter\nsat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with\nJesus\nof\nGalilee\n.\n70\nBut he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.\n71\nAnd when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with\nJesus\nof\nNazareth\n.\n72\nAnd again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.\n73\nAnd after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to\nPeter\n, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.\n74\nThen began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.

And\nJesus\nsaid unto him,\nThou sayest.\n12\nAnd when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.\n13\nThen said\nPilate\nunto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?\n14\nAnd he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.\n15\nNow at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.\n16\nAnd they had then a notable prisoner, called\nBarabbas\n.\n17\nTherefore when they were gathered together,\nPilate\nsaid unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you?\nBarabbas\n, or\nJesus\nwhich is called\nChrist\n?\n18\nFor he knew that for envy they had delivered him.\n19\nWhen he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.\n20\nBut the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask\nBarabbas\n, and destroy\nJesus\n.\n21\nThe governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said,\nBarabbas\n.\n22\nPilate\nsaith unto them, What shall I do then with\nJesus\nwhich is called\nChrist\n? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.\n23\nAnd the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.\n24\nWhen\nPilate\nsaw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.\n25\nThen answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.\n26\nThen released he\nBarabbas\nunto them: and when he had scourged\nJesus\n, he delivered him to be crucified.\n27\nThen the soldiers of the governor took\nJesus\ninto the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.\n28\nAnd they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.\n29\nAnd when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!\n30\nAnd they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.\n31\nAnd after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.\n32\nAnd as they came out, they found a man of\nCyrene\n,\nSimon\nby name: him they compelled to bear his cross.\n33\nAnd when they were come unto a place called\nGolgotha\n, that is to say, a place of a skull,\n34\nThey gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.\n35\nAnd they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.\n36\nAnd sitting down they watched him there;\n37\nAnd set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\n38\nThen were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.\n39\nAnd they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,\n40\nAnd saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.\n41\nLikewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,\n42\nHe saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of\nIsrael\n, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.\n43\nHe trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.\n44\nThe thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\n45\nNow from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.\n46\nAnd about the ninth hour\nJesus\ncried with a loud voice, saying,\nEli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\n47\nSome of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.\n48\nAnd straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.\n49\nThe rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.\n50\nJesus\n, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.\n51\nAnd, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;\n52\nAnd the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,\n53\nAnd came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.\n54\nNow when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching\nJesus\n, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.\n55\nAnd many women were there beholding afar off, which followed\nJesus\nfrom\nGalilee\n, ministering unto him:\n56\nAmong which was\nMary\nMagdalene\n, and\nMary\nthe mother of\nJames\nand\nJoses\n, and the mother of\nZebedee\n's children.\n57\nWhen the even was come, there came a rich man of\nArimathæa\n, named\nJoseph\n, who also himself was\nJesus\n' disciple:\n58\nHe went to\nPilate\n, and begged the body of\nJesus\n. Then\nPilate\ncommanded the body to be delivered.\n59\nAnd when\nJoseph\nhad taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,\n60\nAnd laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.\n61\nAnd there was\nMary\nMagdalene\n, and the other\nMary\n, sitting over against the sepulchre.\n62\nNow the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto\nPilate\n,\n63\nSaying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,\nAfter three days I will rise again.\n64\nCommand therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.\n65\nPilate\nsaid unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.\n66\nSo they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China."

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.\n15\nNeither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.\n16\nLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\n17\nThink not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\n18\nFor verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\n19\nWhosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\n20\nFor I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n21\nYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:\n22\nBut I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.\n23\nTherefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;\n24\nLeave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.\n25\nAgree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.\n26\nVerily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.\n27\nYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:\n28\nBut I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\n29\nAnd if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\n30\nAnd if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\n31\nIt hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:\n32\nBut I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.\n33\nAgain, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:\n34\nBut I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:\n35\nNor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by\nJerusalem\n; for it is the city of the great King.\n36\nNeither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.\n37\nBut let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.\n38\nYe have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:\n39\nBut I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\n40\nAnd if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.\n41\nAnd whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.\n42\nGive to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.\n43\nYe have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.\n44\nBut I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;\n45\nThat ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\n46\nFor if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?\n47\nAnd if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?\n48\nBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China."

Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n3\nBut when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:\n4\nThat thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.\n5\nAnd when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n6\nBut thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n7\nBut when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\n8\nBe not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.\n9\nAfter this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\n10\nThy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\n11\nGive us this day our daily bread.\n12\nAnd forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\n13\nAnd lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.\n14\nFor if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:\n15\nBut if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\n16\nMoreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n17\nBut thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;\n18\nThat thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.\n19\nLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:\n20\nBut lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:\n21\nFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n22\nThe light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.\n23\nBut if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\n24\nNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n25\nTherefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\n26\nBehold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?\n27\nWhich of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?\n28\nAnd why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:\n29\nAnd yet I say unto you, That even\nSolomon\nin all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\n30\nWherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?\n31\nTherefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?\n32\n(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\n33\nBut seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\n34\nTake therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China."

Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\n17\nEven so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.\n18\nA good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\n19\nEvery tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.\n20\nWherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.\n21\nNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\n22\nMany will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?\n23\nAnd then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\n24\nTherefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:\n25\nAnd the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.\n26\nAnd every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:\n27\nAnd the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.\n28\nAnd it came to pass, when\nJesus\nhad ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:\n29\nFor he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China."
