        "content": "Start by focusing on the four survival pillars: shelter, water, fire, and food. Shelter: Use branches, leaves, and debris to insulate and protect yourself from wind/rain. Water: Find streams, collect rain, or use plastic to make a solar still. Always boil or purify. Fire: Use dry grass and twigs. Start with a lighter, matches, or friction methods like a bow drill. Food: Prioritize edible plants, bugs, and small game. Fish if water is near. Use traps or snares."
