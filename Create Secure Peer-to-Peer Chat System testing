Secure Peer-to-Peer Chat System - Implementation Plan

📌 Overview

The goal is to create a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging system that does not rely on central servers, ensuring user anonymity and resilience against surveillance.

🛠️ Key Features & Security Measures

✅ No Central Servers – Messages are relayed peer-to-peer (P2P) for security.✅ End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) – Using AES-256 + Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.✅ Identity Protection – Anonymous user verification via cryptographic keys.✅ Self-Destructing Messages – Messages auto-delete based on time or read status.✅ Offline Messaging Support – Messages can be stored and relayed later.✅ Decentralized Hosting – Using IPFS, Tor, or I2P for secure data relays.

📌 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) Implementation

How It Works:

Each user generates a private and public key.

Users exchange public keys.

Each user computes a shared secret key.

This shared key is used for encrypting messages with AES-256.

Python Implementation:
import secrets
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import dh
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization, hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.hkdf import HKDF
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
import os

# Generate a 2048-bit prime for Diffie-Hellman key exchange
parameters = dh.generate_parameters(generator=2, key_size=2048)

# User A (Alice) generates a private and public key
private_key_A = parameters.generate_private_key()
public_key_A = private_key_A.public_key()

# User B (Bob) generates a private and public key
private_key_B = parameters.generate_private_key()
public_key_B = private_key_B.public_key()

# Exchange public keys and compute shared secret
shared_key_A = private_key_A.exchange(public_key_B)
shared_key_B = private_key_B.exchange(public_key_A)

assert shared_key_A == shared_key_B  # Verify both computed the same key

# Convert shared key to a usable format (hashing to derive AES key)
hkdf = HKDF(algorithm=hashes.SHA256(), length=32, salt=None, info=b'peer-to-peer chat')
derived_key = hkdf.derive(shared_key_A)

print(f"Derived AES Encryption Key: {derived_key.hex()}")  # This key will be used for encrypting messages

📌 Tor Integration for Anonymous Messaging Transport

To ensure secure and untraceable message delivery, we will integrate Tor hidden services into the system.

1️⃣ Full Tor-Based Message Relay System

✔ Messages are sent through onion services instead of the regular internet.✔ Each peer in the network hosts a hidden service endpoint for messaging.✔ Uses asynchronous relaying to avoid direct connections.

Python Implementation (Tor Message Relay):

from stem.control import Controller
import socket

def start_tor_hidden_service():
    with Controller.from_port(port=9051) as controller:
        controller.authenticate()
        hidden_service = controller.create_ephemeral_hidden_service({80: 5000}, await_publication=True)
        print(f"Tor Hidden Service Running: {hidden_service.service_id}.onion")
        return hidden_service.service_id

def send_tor_message(message, target_onion):
    try:
        with socket.create_connection((target_onion, 5000)) as sock:
            sock.sendall(message.encode())
            response = sock.recv(1024)
            print("Received response:", response.decode())
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error sending message:", str(e))

# Example usage
tor_address = start_tor_hidden_service()
print(f"Your chat server is accessible at {tor_address}.onion")

2️⃣ Ensuring Seamless Tor Connectivity

✔ Users automatically connect to Tor on startup.✔ Implementing a Tor bootstrap check to ensure connectivity.

3️⃣ Secure Message Transmission Testing & Optimization

✔ Validate latency, reliability, and encryption integrity of Tor message relay.✔ Ensure messages are fully encrypted before transmission.✔ Improve Performance & Error Handling – Implement automated retries for failed transmissions.✔ Develop a Logging System – Track messages sent and received for debugging purposes.

Automated Testing Script for Tor Messaging:

import time
from stem.control import Controller
import socket

def check_tor_bootstrap():
    """Checks if Tor is properly bootstrapped and ready for connections."""
    with Controller.from_port(port=9051) as controller:
        controller.authenticate()
        bootstrap_status = controller.get_info("status/bootstrap-phase")
        print("Tor Bootstrap Status:", bootstrap_status)


def test_message_relay(target_onion):
    """Tests sending and receiving messages over Tor."""
    test_message = "Test message over Tor at " + str(time.time())
    try:
        with socket.create_connection((target_onion, 5000)) as sock:
            sock.sendall(test_message.encode())
            response = sock.recv(1024)
            print("Test message sent successfully! Received:", response.decode())
    except Exception as e:
        print("Tor relay test failed:", str(e))

# Example Usage
check_tor_bootstrap()
