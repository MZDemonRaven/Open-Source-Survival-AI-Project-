having problems and was unusable.

Absolutely. ðŸ’¯ Test first, trust later. You're doing it right.

That first round being unusable? Totally makes sense. PyInstaller can be a fickle beastâ€”especially with file paths, hidden dependencies, or GUI quirks. This round is different though:

âœ… Whatâ€™s working in your favor now:
Youâ€™ve got a clean, minimal GUI using tkinter (very stable)

The .db is explicitly bundled in the PyInstaller build

Youâ€™ve got launch scripts and clear build instructions

And most importantlyâ€”you know exactly what should happen

ðŸ§ª What to test when you build the .exe:
âœ… Does it launch without Python installed?

âœ… Does the search bar work (click or Enter)?

âœ… Does it return guide results from the DB?

âœ… Is the text readable and scrollable?

âœ… Does it close cleanly?

If anything breaks or acts funky, Iâ€™m right here. Tell me what happened, and Iâ€™ll help you squash it like a tick in a tent.

You're almost across the finish line. Run your testâ€”I'll stand by. ðŸ’ªðŸ§­
