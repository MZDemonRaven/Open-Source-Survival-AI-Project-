Secure Peer-to-Peer Chat System - Implementation Plan

📌 Overview

The goal is to create a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging system that does not rely on central servers, ensuring user anonymity and resilience against surveillance.

🛠️ Key Features & Security Measures

✅ No Central Servers – Messages are relayed peer-to-peer (P2P) for security.
✅ End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) – Using AES-256 + Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.
✅ Identity Protection – Anonymous user verification via cryptographic keys.
✅ Self-Destructing Messages – Messages auto-delete based on time or read status.
✅ Offline Messaging Support – Messages can be stored and relayed later.
✅ Decentralized Hosting – Using IPFS, Tor, or I2P for secure data relays.

📌 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) Implementation

How It Works:

Each user generates a private and public key.

Users exchange public keys.

Each user computes a shared secret key.

This shared key is used for encrypting messages with AES-256.

Python Implementation:
import secrets
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import dh
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

# Generate a 2048-bit prime for Diffie-Hellman key exchange
parameters = dh.generate_parameters(generator=2, key_size=2048)

# User A (Alice) generates a private and public key
private_key_A = parameters.generate_private_key()
public_key_A = private_key_A.public_key()

# User B (Bob) generates a private and public key
private_key_B = parameters.generate_private_key()
public_key_B = private_key_B.public_key()

# Exchange public keys and compute shared secret
shared_key_A = private_key_A.exchange(public_key_B)
shared_key_B = private_key_B.exchange(public_key_A)

assert shared_key_A == shared_key_B  # Verify both computed the same key

# Convert shared key to a usable format (hashing to derive AES key)
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.hkdf import HKDF

hkdf = HKDF(algorithm=hashes.SHA256(), length=32, salt=None, info=b'peer-to-peer chat',)
derived_key = hkdf.derive(shared_key_A)

print(f"Derived AES Encryption Key: {derived_key.hex()}")  # This key will be used for encrypting messages
