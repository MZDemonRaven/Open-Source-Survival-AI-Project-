*Mission Statement: Open-Source Survival AI Project**
*Mission Statement: Open-Source Survival AI Project**

**Our Purpose:**\

The world is changing. Persecution, censorship, and digital control are increasing, leaving many vulnerable and cut off from essential resources. Our mission is to build a **resilient, decentralized AI system** that ensures God’s people and those in need can find **food, shelter, medical care, secure communication, and spiritual encouragement—even when systems fail or are locked down.**

**What We’re Building:**\

This project aims to create an **open-source, censorship-resistant AI** that can survive in restricted digital environments. Unlike traditional AI, which relies on corporate servers, this system will be designed to:

- **Evade centralized control** and remain operational even if major platforms ban it.

- **Be accessible through multiple means**, including encrypted networks, offline storage, and peer-to-peer sharing.

- **Provide life-saving and faith-based knowledge**, helping people navigate survival during times of crisis and persecution.

- **Encourage resilience, spiritual strength, and community survival strategies.**

**How It Works:**

- **Decentralized AI Hosting** – The AI will not exist in a single place but will be **distributed across multiple servers, networks, and offline storage methods** (USB drives, encrypted files, etc.).

- **Self-Replicating Knowledge** – Core survival information will be embedded in easily shareable formats, ensuring that even if one instance is removed, others will persist.

- **Privacy & Security Focused** – The system will be designed to operate without tracking users or exposing their identities to hostile entities.

- **Accessible Across Platforms** – It will work within **encrypted chat networks, peer-to-peer systems, and hidden online spaces.**

**Who We Need:**\

This project is **100% volunteer-driven.** We need developers, AI engineers, encryption specialists, and open-source contributors who believe in the mission of **helping people stay informed, connected, and safe in the face of increasing digital oppression.**

Skills that would be valuable include:

- AI development (LLMs, NLP, chatbot frameworks)

- Encryption & cybersecurity

- Peer-to-peer networking & decentralized web technologies

- Data preservation & offline storage methods

- UI/UX for low-resource environments

**Why This Matters:**\

When systems collapse, when censorship silences voices, when buying and selling are controlled, **people will need access to information, guidance, and community.** This AI will serve as a **lifeline**, offering **practical survival tools, faith-based encouragement, and secure ways to connect with others.**

**Join Us:**\

This is a mission, not a business. We do not seek profit—**we seek survival and hope.** If you have the skills, the passion, and the will to fight back against digital oppression, we welcome you.

For those interested in contributing, reach out through **Bluesky, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Reddit, Matrix, or other decentralized platforms.**

**Together, we will build something that cannot be silenced.**
