Open-Source Survival AI Project - Coding Roadmap

Phase 1: Foundation & Research

✅ Define Core Functions – What will the AI do? (Secure chat, knowledge base, resource locator?)
✅ Choose Programming Language – Python is recommended for AI, encryption, and networking.
✅ Select AI Model – Use an open-source LLM like GPT-J, Llama 2, or PrivateGPT.
✅ Study Decentralized Technologies – Learn about IPFS, peer-to-peer networking, and encryption tools.

Phase 2: Building the Core AI

✅ Set Up Development Environment – Install Python, VS Code, GitHub, and AI libraries.
✅ Train or Fine-Tune the AI – Use a pre-trained model or fine-tune for survival-focused responses.
✅ Create a Basic Chat Interface – Develop a simple text-based AI chatbot that can provide guidance.
✅ Test AI on Local Machine – Ensure it runs without external dependencies.

Phase 3: Decentralization & Security

✅ Implement Peer-to-Peer Hosting – Use IPFS or a similar protocol to store knowledge without centralized servers.
✅ Add Encryption for Privacy – Implement end-to-end encryption for user safety.
✅ Develop Offline Functionality – Ensure users can access survival knowledge even without an internet connection.
✅ Test AI Resilience – Simulate censorship and data takedowns to test resistance.

Phase 4: User Interface & Accessibility

✅ Create a Web-Based UI – Build a simple front-end interface for ease of access.
✅ Develop Mobile & Lightweight Versions – Ensure the AI can run on low-power devices.
✅ Add Voice or Local Speech Recognition – Allow users to interact hands-free.

Phase 5: Deployment & Expansion

✅ Host in Decentralized Networks – Deploy across multiple peer-to-peer networks and encrypted nodes.
✅ Create a Knowledge Distribution System – Set up USB, SD card, or downloadable offline files.
✅ Gather Feedback & Improve – Work with testers to refine security, functionality, and knowledge base.

Long-Term Goals

Improve AI adaptability and knowledge retention.

Increase resistance to censorship and detection.

Expand user accessibility and integration into encrypted chat networks.
