        "content": "In Antarctica, wind and extreme cold can kill quickly. Dig a snow trench if nothing else is available. Use snow blocks to form walls or cover the trench with your sled, tarp, or anything windproof. Line the floor with insulation like clothing or dry gear. Never sleep directly on snow or ice\u2014use a layer between you and the ground to prevent heat loss."

Use body heat\u2014share a sleeping bag if necessary. Block wind with any material you have: tarps, bags, snow walls."

If fuel is limited, hold snow in a sealed bottle inside your clothing to melt slowly. Always sanitize if possible by boiling or using tablets."

Use a compass or the direction of prevailing wind to orient. Avoid traveling alone\u2014always rope together in teams to avoid losing one another in snow drifts."
