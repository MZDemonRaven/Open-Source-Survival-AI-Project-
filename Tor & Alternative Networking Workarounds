🔄 Alternative Networking Solutions
If Tor is unavailable, consider using these alternative networks for privacy and survival communications:

🕵️ I2P (Invisible Internet Project) – Encrypted overlay network for anonymous browsing & file sharing.
🌍 IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) – A decentralized network for hosting and retrieving files.
📡 Briar – Peer-to-peer messaging app that works offline or over Tor.
📶 RetroShare – Encrypted P2P chat, file sharing, and forums.
📡 Serval Mesh – A mesh network system that enables communication without cell service.
🌲 Offline Communication & Survival Messaging
In a grid-down or censorship-heavy scenario, use these tools for secure offline communication:

Briar & Serval Mesh – Local messaging without the internet.
USB Sneakernet – Physically transfer encrypted messages.
Air-gapped Computers – For sensitive data storage & analysis.
QR Code Message Sharing – Encode and decode messages without traditional networks.
🚀 How to Contribute
Test the workarounds – If you find issues, report them on GitHub.
Suggest new methods – If you know better tools for Tor access, P2P, or offline communication, submit an issue or PR.
For full details, check tor_workarounds.json inside the /config folder.

This will help users troubleshoot connectivity, explore alternative networks, and prepare for total disconnection in extreme situations. 🚀🔥
