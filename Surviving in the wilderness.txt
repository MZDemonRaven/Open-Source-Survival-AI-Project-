1. Fire-Making 🔥
Fire is essential for warmth, cooking, signaling, and protection.

Fire-starting without matches: Flint and steel, friction methods (bow drill, hand drill, fire plow), and solar fire-starting (ice or magnifying glass).
Tinder gathering: Dry leaves, grass, pine needles, birch bark, and fungus.
Fire safety: How to build and maintain a fire without risking wildfires.
2. Water Sourcing and Purification 💧
Clean water is critical for survival.

Finding water: Streams, lakes, morning dew, plant transpiration, digging for groundwater.
Purification methods: Boiling, solar stills, water filtration with sand/charcoal, chemical purification (iodine, bleach).
Avoiding contaminated water: Stagnant water, sources near animal activity, and unfiltered water from unknown origins.
3. Shelter Building 🏕️
A good shelter protects against the elements and improves survival chances.

Types of shelters: Lean-to, debris hut, A-frame, wickiup, cave shelter, snow quinzhee.
Insulation: Using leaves, grass, moss, and animal hides to trap body heat.
Choosing a location: Away from flood zones, on stable ground, and near resources.
4. Food Foraging and Hunting 🌿🏹
Knowing how to find and prepare food is crucial for long-term survival.

Edible plants: Wild berries, roots, nuts, mushrooms (with caution).
Trapping and hunting: Deadfall traps, snare traps, spears, bow and arrows, atlatl.
Fishing techniques: Spear fishing, fish traps, hand fishing, making fish hooks from bones.
Insect protein: Grasshoppers, ants, crickets (high in protein, easy to find).
5. Tool and Weapon Making 🛠️
Primitive tools help with survival tasks.

Stone tools: Flint knapping to make cutting tools and spear points.
Cordage making: Using bark strips, sinew, or plant fibers for binding.
Wooden tools: Carving spears, clubs, digging sticks, and traps.
6. Navigation and Orientation 🧭
Finding your way without a map or compass is essential.

Using the sun: The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
Navigating with stars: The North Star (Polaris) provides direction at night.
Reading nature signs: River flow direction, moss growth on trees, animal trails.
7. Weather Prediction ☁️
Understanding the weather can prevent exposure to dangerous conditions.

Cloud reading: Dark, low clouds signal rain; wispy, high clouds indicate fair weather.
Animal behavior: Birds flying low means bad weather is coming; frogs croaking loudly indicate rain.
Wind changes: A sudden shift in wind direction can mean a storm is approaching.
8. First Aid and Emergency Care ⛑️
Injuries in the wilderness can be life-threatening without proper care.

Treating wounds: Cleaning cuts with boiled water, using moss as bandages.
Bone setting: Immobilizing broken limbs with makeshift splints.
Herbal medicine: Using plants like yarrow for bleeding, willow bark for pain relief.
CPR and rescue signals: Knowing how to perform CPR and create distress signals (SOS signals, smoke signals).
9. Camouflage and Stealth 🌲
Staying hidden from predators (animal or human) can be a lifesaving skill.

Blending with nature: Using mud, leaves, or charcoal for concealment.
Silent movement: Walking carefully to avoid breaking branches or alerting wildlife.
Scent masking: Avoid strong-smelling soaps or food that attract animals.
10. Signaling for Rescue 📢
If lost, knowing how to get help is crucial.

Smoke signals: Creating three puffs of smoke to signal distress.
Sound signals: Three loud whistles, rocks banging, or shouting.
Ground signals: Large SOS letters made with stones or logs.
Mirror or light reflection: Using a shiny surface to reflect sunlight toward search parties.
11. Psychological Resilience 🧠
Survival is as much about mental strength as physical preparedness.

Staying calm: Panic leads to mistakes; maintaining a clear mind improves decision-making.
Keeping busy: Finding tasks helps avoid despair and keeps morale high.
Faith and determination: Believing in survival and maintaining hope are powerful motivators.
