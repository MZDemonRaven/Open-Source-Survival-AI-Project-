and, behold, ye have filled <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>Then <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>The God of our fathers raised up <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to <span class=\"place\">Israel</span>, and forgiveness of sins. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"32\">32 </span>And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"33\">33 </span>When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"34\">34 </span>Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"35\">35 </span>And said unto them, Ye men of <span class=\"place\">Israel</span>, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"36\">36 </span>For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"37\">37 </span>After this man rose up <span class=\"person\">Judas </span>of <span class=\"place\">Galilee </span>in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"38\">38 </span>And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"39\">39 </span>But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"40\">40 </span>And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>, and let them go. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"41\">41 </span>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"42\">42 </span>And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ</span>. \n</p>\n<!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->\n</div>\n</div><!-- /textOptions -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wbox end -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wrapper end -->\n</div><!-- /main -->\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<div class=\"shareright ym-noprint\">\n<!--next chapter start/Top-->\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Page TOP\" href=\"#mytop\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_up.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowup\"/>&nbsp;</a>\n\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Next chapter\" href=\"6.htm#0\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_right.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowright\"/>&nbsp;</a></p>\n<!--next chapter end-->\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"redborder\" class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<p class=\"alignCenter\">Courtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_top\">International Biblical Association</a>, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\t</p>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</body>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery-1.8.0.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.waypoints.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/sticky.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/bar-ui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.dropotron.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel-viewport.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/util.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n</html>\n",

and <span class=\"person\">Joseph</span>'s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>Then sent <span class=\"person\">Joseph</span>, and called his father <span class=\"person\">Jacob </span>to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>So <span class=\"person\">Jacob </span>went down into <span class=\"place\">Egypt</span>, and died, he, and our fathers, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that <span class=\"person\">Abraham </span>bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to <span class=\"person\">Abraham</span>, the people grew and multiplied in <span class=\"place\">Egypt</span>, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>Till another king arose, which knew not <span class=\"person\">Joseph</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>In which time <span class=\"person\">Moses </span>was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>And <span class=\"person\">Moses </span>was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of <span class=\"place\">Israel</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>Then fled <span class=\"person\">Moses </span>at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>When <span class=\"person\">Moses </span>saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"32\">32 </span>Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of <span class=\"person\">Abraham</span>, and the God of <span class=\"person\">Isaac</span>, and the God of <span class=\"person\">Jacob</span>. Then <span class=\"person\">Moses </span>trembled, and durst not behold. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"33\">33 </span>Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"34\">34 </span>I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in <span class=\"place\">Egypt</span>, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into <span class=\"place\">Egypt</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"35\">35 </span>This <span class=\"person\">Moses </span>whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"36\">36 </span>He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of <span class=\"place\">Egypt</span>, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"37\">37 </span>This is that <span class=\"person\">Moses</span>, which said unto the children of <span class=\"place\">Israel</span>, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"38\">38 </span>This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"39\">39 </span>To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into <span class=\"place\">Egypt</span>, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"40\">40 </span>Saying unto <span class=\"person\">Aaron</span>, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this <span class=\"person\">Moses</span>, which brought us out of the land of <span class=\"place\">Egypt</span>, we wot not what is become of him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"41\">41 </span>And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"42\">42 </span>Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of <span class=\"place\">Israel</span>, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"43\">43 </span>Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond <span class=\"place\">Babylon</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"44\">44 </span>Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto <span class=\"person\">Moses</span>, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"45\">45 </span>Which also our fathers that came after brought in with <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span>into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of <span class=\"person\">David</span>; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"46\">46 </span>Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of <span class=\"person\">Jacob</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"47\">47 </span>But <span class=\"person\">Solomon </span>built him an house. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"48\">48 </span>Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"49\">49 </span>Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"50\">50 </span>Hath not my hand made all these things? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"51\">51 </span>Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"52\">52 </span>Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"53\">53 </span>Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"54\">54 </span>When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"55\">55 </span>But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span>standing on the right hand of God, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"56\">56 </span>And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"57\">57 </span>Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"58\">58 </span>And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was <span class=\"person\">Saul</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"59\">59 </span>And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>, receive my spirit. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"60\">60 </span>And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.

And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of <span class=\"place\">Judæa </span>and <span class=\"place\">Samaria</span>, except the apostles. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"2\">2 </span>And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"3\">3 </span>As for <span class=\"person\">Saul</span>, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"4\">4 </span>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"5\">5 </span>Then <span class=\"person\">Philip </span>went down to the city of <span class=\"place\">Samaria</span>, and preached <span class=\"person\">Christ </span>unto them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"6\">6 </span>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which <span class=\"person\">Philip </span>spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"7\">7 </span>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"8\">8 </span>And there was great joy in that city. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"9\">9 </span>But there was a certain man, called <span class=\"person\">Simon</span>, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of <span class=\"place\">Samaria</span>, giving out that himself was some great one: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"10\">10 </span>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"11\">11 </span>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>But when they believed <span class=\"person\">Philip </span>preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ</span>, they were baptized, both men and women. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>Then <span class=\"person\">Simon </span>himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with <span class=\"person\">Philip</span>, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>Now when the apostles which were at <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>heard that <span class=\"place\">Samaria </span>had received the word of God, they sent unto them <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>and <span class=\"person\">John</span>: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>.) \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>And when <span class=\"person\">Simon </span>saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>But <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>Then answered <span class=\"person\">Simon</span>, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>And the angel of the Lord spake unto <span class=\"person\">Philip</span>, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>unto <span class=\"place\">Gaza</span>, which is desert. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of <span class=\"place\">Ethiopia</span>, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>for to worship, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>Then the Spirit said unto <span class=\"person\">Philip</span>, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>And <span class=\"person\">Philip </span>ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me?

And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"5\">5 </span>And now send men to Joppa, and call for one <span class=\"person\">Simon</span>, whose surname is <span class=\"person\">Peter</span>: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"6\">6 </span>He lodgeth with one <span class=\"person\">Simon </span>a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"7\">7 </span>And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"8\">8 </span>And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"9\">9 </span><span class=\"place\">On </span>the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"10\">10 </span>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"11\">11 </span>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>And there came a voice to him, <span class=\"word\">Rise, <span class=\"person\">Peter</span>; kill, and eat. </span>\n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>But <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>And the voice spake unto him again the second time, <span class=\"word\">What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. </span>\n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>Now while <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for <span class=\"person\">Simon</span>'s house, and stood before the gate, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>And called, and asked whether <span class=\"person\">Simon</span>, which was surnamed <span class=\"person\">Peter</span>, were lodged there. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>While <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>Then <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>And the morrow after they entered into <span class=\"place\">Cæsarea</span>. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>And as <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>But <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"32\">32 </span>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither <span class=\"person\">Simon</span>, whose surname is <span class=\"person\">Peter</span>; he is lodged in the house of one <span class=\"person\">Simon </span>a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"33\">33 </span>Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"34\">34 </span>Then <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"35\">35 </span>But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"36\">36 </span>The word which God sent unto the children of <span class=\"place\">Israel</span>, preaching peace by <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ</span>: (he is Lord of all:) \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"37\">37 </span>That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all <span class=\"place\">Judæa</span>, and began from <span class=\"place\">Galilee</span>, after the baptism which <span class=\"person\">John </span>preached; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"38\">38 </span>How God anointed <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span>of <span class=\"place\">Nazareth </span>with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"39\">39 </span>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"40\">40 </span>Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"41\">41 </span>Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"42\">42 </span>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"43\">43 </span>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"44\">44 </span>While <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"45\">45 </span>And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with <span class=\"person\">Peter</span>, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"46\">46 </span>For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered <span class=\"person\">Peter</span>, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"47\">47 </span>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"48\">48 </span>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.

Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for <span class=\"person\">Simon</span>, whose surname is <span class=\"person\">Peter</span>; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, <span class=\"word\"><span class=\"person\">John </span>indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. </span>\n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ</span>; what was I, that I could withstand God? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>And some of them were men of Cyprus and <span class=\"place\">Cyrene</span>, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek <span class=\"person\">Saul</span>: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.

And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>And in these days came prophets from <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>unto Antioch. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of <span class=\"person\">Claudius Cæsar</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in <span class=\"place\">Judæa</span>: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and <span class=\"person\">Saul</span>. \n</p>\n<!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->\n</div>\n</div><!-- /textOptions -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wbox end -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wrapper end -->\n</div><!-- /main -->\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<div class=\"shareright ym-noprint\">\n<!--next chapter start/Top-->\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Page TOP\" href=\"#mytop\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_up.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowup\"/>&nbsp;</a>\n\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Next chapter\" href=\"12.htm#0\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_right.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowright\"/>&nbsp;</a></p>\n<!--next chapter end-->\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"redborder\" class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<p class=\"alignCenter\">Courtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_top\">International Biblical Association</a>, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\t</p>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</body>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery-1.8.0.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.waypoints.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/sticky.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/bar-ui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.dropotron.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel-viewport.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/util.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n</html>\n",

And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>Now when <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and <span class=\"person\">John </span>departing from them returned to <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>Then <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of <span class=\"place\">Israel</span>, and ye that fear God, give audience. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>The God of this people of <span class=\"place\">Israel </span>chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of <span class=\"place\">Egypt</span>, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until <span class=\"person\">Samuel </span>the prophet. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them <span class=\"person\">Saul </span>the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of <span class=\"person\">Benjamin</span>, by the space of forty years. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them <span class=\"person\">David </span>to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found <span class=\"person\">David </span>the son of <span class=\"person\">Jesse</span>, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto <span class=\"place\">Israel </span>a Saviour, <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>When <span class=\"person\">John </span>had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of <span class=\"place\">Israel</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>And as <span class=\"person\">John </span>fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>Men and brethren, children of the stock of <span class=\"person\">Abraham</span>, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>For they that dwell at <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they <span class=\"person\">Pilate </span>that he should be slain. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>But God raised him from the dead: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from <span class=\"place\">Galilee </span>to <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>, who are his witnesses unto the people. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"32\">32 </span>And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"33\">33 </span>God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span>again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"34\">34 </span>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of <span class=\"person\">David</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"35\">35 </span>Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"36\">36 </span>For <span class=\"person\">David</span>, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"37\">37 </span>But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"38\">38 </span>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"39\">39 </span>And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of <span class=\"person\">Moses</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"40\">40 </span>Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"41\">41 </span>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"42\">42 </span>And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"43\">43 </span>Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"44\">44 </span>And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"45\">45 </span>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, contradicting and blaspheming. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"46\">46 </span>Then <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"47\">47 </span>For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"48\">48 </span>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"49\">49 </span>And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"50\">50 </span>But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"51\">51 </span>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"52\">52 </span>And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost. \n</p>\n<!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->\n</div>\n</div><!-- /textOptions -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wbox end -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wrapper end -->\n</div><!-- /main -->\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<div class=\"shareright ym-noprint\">\n<!--next chapter start/Top-->\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Page TOP\" href=\"#mytop\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_up.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowup\"/>&nbsp;</a>\n\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Next chapter\" href=\"14.htm#0\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_right.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowright\"/>&nbsp;</a></p>\n<!--next chapter end-->\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"redborder\" class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<p class=\"alignCenter\">Courtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_top\">International Biblical Association</a>, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\t</p>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</body>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery-1.8.0.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.waypoints.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/sticky.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/bar-ui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.dropotron.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel-viewport.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/util.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n</html>\n",

Word of God:--><span class=\"dimver\">   \n</span>\n<p><span class=\"verse\" id=\"1\">1 </span>And certain men which came down from <span class=\"place\">Judæa </span>taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of <span class=\"person\">Moses</span>, ye cannot be saved. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"2\">2 </span>When therefore <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>unto the apostles and elders about this question. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"3\">3 </span>And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and <span class=\"place\">Samaria</span>, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"4\">4 </span>And when they were come to <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"5\">5 </span>But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of <span class=\"person\">Moses</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"6\">6 </span>And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"7\">7 </span>And when there had been much disputing, <span class=\"person\">Peter </span>rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"8\">8 </span>And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"9\">9 </span>And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"10\">10 </span>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"11\">11 </span>But we believe that through the grace of the LORD <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ </span>we shall be saved, even as they. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>And after they had held their peace, <span class=\"person\">James </span>answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span><span class=\"person\">Simeon </span>hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of <span class=\"person\">David</span>, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>For <span class=\"person\">Moses </span>of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and Barnabas; namely, <span class=\"person\">Judas </span>surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and <span class=\"place\">Syria </span>and Cilicia: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>We have sent therefore <span class=\"person\">Judas </span>and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"32\">32 </span>And <span class=\"person\">Judas </span>and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"33\">33 </span>And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"34\">34 </span>Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"35\">35 </span><span class=\"person\">Paul </span>also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"36\">36 </span>And some days after <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"37\">37 </span>And Barnabas determined to take with them <span class=\"person\">John</span>, whose surname was Mark. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"38\">38 </span>But <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"39\">39 </span>And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"40\">40 </span>And <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"41\">41 </span>And he went through <span class=\"place\">Syria </span>and Cilicia, confirming the churches. \n</p>\n<!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->\n</div>\n</div><!-- /textOptions -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wbox end -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wrapper end -->\n</div><!-- /main -->\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<div class=\"shareright ym-noprint\">\n<!--next chapter start/Top-->\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Page TOP\" href=\"#mytop\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_up.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowup\"/>&nbsp;</a>\n\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Next chapter\" href=\"16.htm#0\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_right.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowright\"/>&nbsp;</a></p>\n<!--next chapter end-->\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"redborder\" class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<p class=\"alignCenter\">Courtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_top\">International Biblical Association</a>, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\t</p>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</body>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery-1.8.0.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.waypoints.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/sticky.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/bar-ui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.dropotron.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel-viewport.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/util.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n</html>\n",

but his father was a Greek: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"2\">2 </span>Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"3\">3 </span>Him would <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"4\">4 </span>And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"5\">5 </span>And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"6\">6 </span>Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"7\">7 </span>After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"8\">8 </span>And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"9\">9 </span>And a vision appeared to <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>in the night; There stood a man of <span class=\"place\">Macedonia</span>, and prayed him, saying, Come over into <span class=\"place\">Macedonia</span>, and help us. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"10\">10 </span>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into <span class=\"place\">Macedonia</span>, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"11\">11 </span>Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>And from thence to <span class=\"place\">Philippi</span>, which is the chief city of that part of <span class=\"place\">Macedonia</span>, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>The same followed <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>And this did she many days. But <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ </span>to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>And at midnight <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>But <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>and Silas, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>And they said, Believe on the Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ</span>, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"32\">32 </span>And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"33\">33 </span>And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"34\">34 </span>And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"35\">35 </span>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"36\">36 </span>And the keeper of the prison told this saying to <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"37\">37 </span>But <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily?

and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>For <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>the day of Pentecost. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"32\">32 </span>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"33\">33 </span>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"34\">34 </span>Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"35\">35 </span>I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>, how he said, <span class=\"word\">It is more blessed to give than to receive. </span>\n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"36\">36 </span>And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"37\">37 </span>And they all wept sore, and fell on <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>'s neck, and kissed him, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"38\">38 </span>Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship. \n</p>\n<!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->\n</div>\n</div><!-- /textOptions -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wbox end -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wrapper end -->\n</div><!-- /main -->\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<div class=\"shareright ym-noprint\">\n<!--next chapter start/Top-->\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Page TOP\" href=\"#mytop\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_up.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowup\"/>&nbsp;</a>\n\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Next chapter\" href=\"21.htm#0\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_right.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowright\"/>&nbsp;</a></p>\n<!--next chapter end-->\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"redborder\" class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<p class=\"alignCenter\">Courtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_top\">International Biblical Association</a>, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\t</p>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</body>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery-1.8.0.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.waypoints.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/sticky.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/bar-ui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.dropotron.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel-viewport.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/util.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n</html>\n",

and all the elders were present. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake <span class=\"person\">Moses</span>, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>Then <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>Crying out, Men of <span class=\"place\">Israel</span>, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>had brought into the temple.) \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>was in an uproar. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"32\">32 </span>Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"33\">33 </span>Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"34\">34 </span>And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"35\">35 </span>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"36\">36 </span>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"37\">37 </span>And as <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"38\">38 </span>Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"39\">39 </span>But <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"40\">40 </span>And when he had given him licence, <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people.

\n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to <span class=\"place\">Caesarea</span>, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>And provide them beasts, that they may set <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>And he wrote a letter after this manner: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him.

\n</span>\n<p><span class=\"verse\" id=\"1\">1 </span>And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"2\">2 </span>And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"3\">3 </span>We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"4\">4 </span>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"5\">5 </span>For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"6\">6 </span>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"7\">7 </span>But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"8\">8 </span>Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"9\">9 </span>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"10\">10 </span>Then <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"11\">11 </span>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>for to worship. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>And he commanded a centurion to keep <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, and heard him concerning the faith in <span class=\"person\">Christ</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>He hoped also that money should have been given him of <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>bound. \n</p>\n<!--... sharper than any twoedged sword...

I appeal unto <span class=\"person\">Cæsar</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto <span class=\"person\">Cæsar</span>? unto <span class=\"person\">Cæsar </span>shalt thou go. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto <span class=\"place\">Cæsarea </span>to salute Festus. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>'s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>About whom, when I was at <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>, which was dead, whom <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>affirmed to be alive. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>, and there be judged of these matters. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>But when <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to <span class=\"person\">Cæsar</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>was brought forth. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem</span>, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him. \n</p>\n<!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->\n</div>\n</div><!-- /textOptions -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wbox end -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wrapper end -->\n</div><!-- /main -->\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<div class=\"shareright ym-noprint\">\n<!--next chapter start/Top-->\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Page TOP\" href=\"#mytop\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_up.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowup\"/>&nbsp;</a>\n\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Next chapter\" href=\"26.htm#0\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_right.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowright\"/>&nbsp;</a></p>\n<!--next chapter end-->\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"redborder\" class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<p class=\"alignCenter\">Courtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_top\">International Biblical Association</a>, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\t</p>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</body>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery-1.8.0.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.waypoints.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/sticky.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/bar-ui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.dropotron.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel-viewport.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/util.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n</html>\n",

And Julius courteously entreated <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"4\">4 </span>And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"5\">5 </span>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"6\">6 </span>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into <span class=\"place\">Italy</span>; and he put us therein. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"7\">7 </span>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"8\">8 </span>And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"9\">9 </span>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>admonished them, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"10\">10 </span>And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"11\">11 </span>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>But after long abstinence <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>Saying, Fear not, <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>; thou must be brought before <span class=\"person\">Cæsar</span>: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span><span class=\"person\">Paul </span>said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"32\">32 </span>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"33\">33 </span>And while the day was coming on, <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"34\">34 </span>Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"35\">35 </span>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"36\">36 </span>Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"37\">37 </span>And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"38\">38 </span>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"39\">39 </span>And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"40\">40 </span>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"41\">41 </span>And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"42\">42 </span>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"43\">43 </span>But the centurion, willing to save <span class=\"person\">Paul</span>, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"44\">44 </span>And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land. \n</p>\n<!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->\n</div>\n</div><!-- /textOptions -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wbox end -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wrapper end -->\n</div><!-- /main -->\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<div class=\"shareright ym-noprint\">\n<!--next chapter start/Top-->\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Page TOP\" href=\"#mytop\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_up.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowup\"/>&nbsp;</a>\n\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Next chapter\" href=\"28.htm#0\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_right.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowright\"/>&nbsp;</a></p>\n<!--next chapter end-->\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"redborder\" class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<p class=\"alignCenter\">Courtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_top\">International Biblical Association</a>, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\t</p>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</body>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery-1.8.0.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.waypoints.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/sticky.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/bar-ui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.dropotron.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel-viewport.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/util.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n</html>\n",

who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"8\">8 </span>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"9\">9 </span>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"10\">10 </span>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"11\">11 </span>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>saw, he thanked God, and took courage. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>And it came to pass, that after three days <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from <span class=\"place\">Jerusalem </span>into the hands of the Romans. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto <span class=\"person\">Cæsar</span>; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of <span class=\"place\">Israel </span>I am bound with this chain. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of <span class=\"place\">Judæa </span>concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning <span class=\"person\">Jesus</span>, both out of the law of <span class=\"person\">Moses</span>, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </span>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </span>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </span>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"29\">29 </span>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"30\">30 </span>And <span class=\"person\">Paul </span>dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"31\">31 </span>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ</span>, with all confidence, no man forbidding him. \n</p>\n<!--... sharper than any twoedged sword... -->\n</div>\n</div><!-- /textOptions -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wbox end -->\n</div><!-- /ym-wrapper end -->\n</div><!-- /main -->\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<div class=\"shareright ym-noprint\">\n<!--next chapter start/Top-->\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Page TOP\" href=\"#mytop\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_up.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowup\"/>&nbsp;</a>\n\n<a class=\"ym-button\" title=\"Next chapter\" href=\"../45/1.htm#0\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../_assets/img/arrow_right.png\" class=\"imageatt\" alt=\"arrowright\"/>&nbsp;</a></p>\n<!--next chapter end-->\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<footer>\n<div class=\"ym-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"redborder\" class=\"ym-wbox\">\n<p class=\"alignCenter\">Courtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of <a href=\"#\" target=\"_top\">International Biblical Association</a>, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\t</p>\n</div>\n</footer>\n</body>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery-1.8.0.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.waypoints.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/sticky.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/bar-ui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/script.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/jquery.dropotron.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/skel-viewport.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/util.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"../_assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n</html>\n"
