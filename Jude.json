for they have gone in the way of <span class=\"person\">Cain</span>, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </span>These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </span>Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </span>And <span class=\"person\">Enoch </span>also, the seventh from <span class=\"person\">Adam</span>, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </span>To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </span>These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </span>But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ</span>; \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </span>How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </span>These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </span>But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </span>Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord <span class=\"person\">Jesus </span><span class=\"person\">Christ </span>unto eternal life. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </span>And of some have compassion, making a difference: \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </span>And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </span>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, \n<br /><span class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </span>To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.
