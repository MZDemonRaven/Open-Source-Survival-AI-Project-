I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.\n25\nAnd\nJesus\nrebuked him, saying,\nHold thy peace, and come out of him.\n26\nAnd when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.\n27\nAnd they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.\n28\nAnd immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about\nGalilee\n.\n29\nAnd forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of\nSimon\nand\nAndrew\n, with\nJames\nand\nJohn\n.\n30\nBut\nSimon\n's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.\n31\nAnd he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.\n32\nAnd at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.\n33\nAnd all the city was gathered together at the door.\n34\nAnd he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.\n35\nAnd in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.\n36\nAnd\nSimon\nand they that were with him followed after him.\n37\nAnd when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.\n38\nAnd he said unto them,\nLet us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.\n39\nAnd he preached in their synagogues throughout all\nGalilee\n, and cast out devils.\n40\nAnd there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\n41\nAnd\nJesus\n, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him,\nI will; be thou clean.\n42\nAnd as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.\n43\nAnd he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;\n44\nAnd saith unto him,\nSee thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which\nMoses\ncommanded, for a testimony unto them.\n45\nBut he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that\nJesus\ncould no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\nThe Gospel according to St. Mark chapter 10 The rich and the heaven\nW\nP\nMore Bibles\nAudio Bibles\nBible\n/\nKJV\nMark\nChapter:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n-\nReset\n+\nChapter 10\n1\nAnd he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of\nJudæa\nby the farther side of\nJordan\n: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.\n2\nAnd the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.\n3\nAnd he answered and said unto them,\nWhat did\nMoses\ncommand you?\n4\nAnd they said,\nMoses\nsuffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.\n5\nAnd\nJesus\nanswered and said unto them,\nFor the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.\n6\nBut from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.\n7\nFor this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;\n8\nAnd they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.\n9\nWhat therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\n10\nAnd in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.\n11\nAnd he saith unto them,\nWhosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.\n12\nAnd if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.\n13\nAnd they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.\n14\nBut when\nJesus\nsaw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them,\nSuffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\n15\nVerily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.\n16\nAnd he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.\n17\nAnd when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?\n18\nAnd\nJesus\nsaid unto him,\nWhy callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.\n19\nThou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.\n20\nAnd he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.\n21\nThen\nJesus\nbeholding him loved him, and said unto him,\nOne thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.\n22\nAnd he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.\n23\nAnd\nJesus\nlooked round about, and saith unto his disciples,\nHow hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\n24\nAnd the disciples were astonished at his words. But\nJesus\nanswereth again, and saith unto them,\nChildren, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!\n25\nIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\n26\nAnd they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?\n27\nAnd\nJesus\nlooking upon them saith,\nWith men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.\n28\nThen\nPeter\nbegan to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.\n29\nAnd\nJesus\nanswered and said,\nVerily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,\n30\nBut he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.\n31\nBut many that are first shall be last; and the last first.\n32\nAnd they were in the way going up to\nJerusalem\n; and\nJesus\nwent before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,\n33\nSaying,\nBehold, we go up to\nJerusalem\n; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:\n34\nAnd they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.\n35\nAnd\nJames\nand\nJohn\n, the sons of\nZebedee\n, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.\n36\nAnd he said unto them,\nWhat would ye that I should do for you?\n37\nThey said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.\n38\nBut\nJesus\nsaid unto them,\nYe know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\n39\nAnd they said unto him, We can. And\nJesus\nsaid unto them,\nYe shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:\n40\nBut to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.\n41\nAnd when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with\nJames\nand\nJohn\n.\n42\nBut\nJesus\ncalled them to him, and saith unto them,\nYe know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.\n43\nBut so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:\n44\nAnd whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.\n45\nFor even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.\n46\nAnd they came to\nJericho\n: and as he went out of\nJericho\nwith his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimæus, the son of Timæus, sat by the highway side begging.\n47\nAnd when he heard that it was\nJesus\nof\nNazareth\n, he began to cry out, and say,\nJesus\n, thou son of\nDavid\n, have mercy on me.\n48\nAnd many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of\nDavid\n, have mercy on me.\n49\nAnd\nJesus\nstood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.\n50\nAnd he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to\nJesus\n.\n51\nAnd\nJesus\nanswered and said unto him,\nWhat wilt thou that I should do unto thee?\nThe blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.\n52\nAnd\nJesus\nsaid unto him,\nGo thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.\nAnd immediately he received his sight, and followed\nJesus\nin the way.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\nThe Gospel according to St. Mark chapter 11 Jesus enters Jerusalem\nW\nP\nMore Bibles\nAudio Bibles\nBible\n/\nKJV\nMark\nChapter:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n-\nReset\n+\nChapter 11\n1\nAnd when they came nigh to\nJerusalem\n, unto\nBethphage\nand\nBethany\n, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,\n2\nAnd saith unto them,\nGo your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.\n3\nAnd if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.\n4\nAnd they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.\n5\nAnd certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?\n6\nAnd they said unto them even as\nJesus\nhad commanded: and they let them go.\n7\nAnd they brought the colt to\nJesus\n, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.\n8\nAnd many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.\n9\nAnd they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:\n10\nBlessed be the kingdom of our father\nDavid\n, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.\n11\nAnd\nJesus\nentered into\nJerusalem\n, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto\nBethany\nwith the twelve.\n12\nAnd on the morrow, when they were come from\nBethany\n, he was hungry:\n13\nAnd seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.\n14\nAnd\nJesus\nanswered and said unto it,\nNo man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.\nAnd his disciples heard it.\n15\nAnd they come to\nJerusalem\n: and\nJesus\nwent into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;\n16\nAnd would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.\n17\nAnd he taught, saying unto them,\nIs it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.\n18\nAnd the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.\n19\nAnd when even was come, he went out of the city.\n20\nAnd in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.\n21\nAnd\nPeter\ncalling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.\n22\nAnd\nJesus\nanswering saith unto them,\nHave faith in God.\n23\nFor verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.\n24\nTherefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\n25\nAnd when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.\n26\nBut if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.\n27\nAnd they come again to\nJerusalem\n: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,\n28\nAnd say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?\n29\nAnd\nJesus\nanswered and said unto them,\nI will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.\n30\nThe baptism of\nJohn\n, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.\n31\nAnd they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?\n32\nBut if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted\nJohn\n, that he was a prophet indeed.\n33\nAnd they answered and said unto\nJesus\n, We cannot tell.

But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them,\nWhy tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.\n16\nAnd they brought it. And he saith unto them,\nWhose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him,\nCaesar\n's.\n17\nAnd\nJesus\nanswering said unto them,\nRender to\nCaesar\nthe things that are\nCaesar\n's, and to God the things that are God's.\nAnd they marvelled at him.\n18\nThen come unto him the Sadducees , which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,\n19\nMaster,\nMoses\nwrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.\n20\nNow there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.\n21\nAnd the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.\n22\nAnd the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.\n23\nIn the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.\n24\nAnd\nJesus\nanswering said unto them,\nDo ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?\n25\nFor when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.\n26\nAnd as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of\nMoses\n, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of\nAbraham\n, and the God of\nIsaac\n, and the God of\nJacob\n?\n27\nHe is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.\n28\nAnd one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?\n29\nAnd\nJesus\nanswered him,\nThe first of all the commandments is, Hear, O\nIsrael\n; The Lord our God is one Lord:\n30\nAnd thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.\n31\nAnd the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.\n32\nAnd the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:\n33\nAnd to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\n34\nAnd when\nJesus\nsaw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him,\nThou art not far from the kingdom of God.\nAnd no man after that durst ask him any question.\n35\nAnd\nJesus\nanswered and said, while he taught in the temple,\nHow say the scribes that\nChrist\nis the son of\nDavid\n?\n36\nFor\nDavid\nhimself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.\n37\nDavid\ntherefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.\n38\nAnd he said unto them in his doctrine,\nBeware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,\n39\nAnd the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:\n40\nWhich devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.\n41\nAnd\nJesus\nsat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.\n42\nAnd there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.\n43\nAnd he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,\nVerily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:\n44\nFor all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\nThe Gospel according to St. Mark chapter 13 Coming afflictions\nW\nP\nMore Bibles\nAudio Bibles\nBible\n/\nKJV\nMark\nChapter:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n-\nReset\n+\nChapter 13\n1\nAnd as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!\n2\nAnd\nJesus\nanswering said unto him,\nSeest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.\n3\nAnd as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,\nPeter\nand\nJames\nand\nJohn\nand\nAndrew\nasked him privately,\n4\nTell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?\n5\nAnd\nJesus\nanswering them began to say,\nTake heed lest any man deceive you:\n6\nFor many shall come in my name, saying, I am\nChrist\n;
