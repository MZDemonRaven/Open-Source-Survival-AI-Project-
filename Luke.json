And the angel departed from her.\n39\nAnd\nMary\narose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;\n40\nAnd entered into the house of\nZacharias\n, and saluted Elisabeth.\n41\nAnd it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of\nMary\n, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:\n42\nAnd she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.\n43\nAnd whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\n44\nFor, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.\n45\nAnd blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.\n46\nAnd\nMary\nsaid, My soul doth magnify the Lord,\n47\nAnd my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\n48\nFor he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.\n49\nFor he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.\n50\nAnd his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.\n51\nHe hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.\n52\nHe hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.\n53\nHe hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.\n54\nHe hath holpen his servant\nIsrael\n, in remembrance of his mercy;\n55\nAs he spake to our fathers, to\nAbraham\n, and to his seed for ever.\n56\nAnd\nMary\nabode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.\n57\nNow Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.\n58\nAnd her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.\n59\nAnd it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him\nZacharias\n, after the name of his father.\n60\nAnd his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called\nJohn\n.\n61\nAnd they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.\n62\nAnd they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.\n63\nAnd he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is\nJohn\n. And they marvelled all.\n64\nAnd his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.\n65\nAnd fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of\nJudæa\n.\n66\nAnd all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.\n67\nAnd his father\nZacharias\nwas filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,\n68\nBlessed be the Lord God of\nIsrael\n; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,\n69\nAnd hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant\nDavid\n;\n70\nAs he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:\n71\nThat we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;\n72\nTo perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;\n73\nThe oath which he sware to our father\nAbraham\n,\n74\nThat he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,\n75\nIn holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.\n76\nAnd thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;\n77\nTo give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,\n78\nThrough the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,\n79\nTo give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.\n80\nAnd the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto\nIsrael\n.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\n\nLuke chapter 10 Mission of the seventy\nW\nP\nMore Bibles\nAudio Bibles\nBible\n/\nKJV\nLuke\nChapter:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n-\nReset\n+\nChapter 10\n1\nAfter these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.\n2\nTherefore said he unto them,\nThe harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.\n3\nGo your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.\n4\nCarry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.\n5\nAnd into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.\n6\nAnd if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.\n7\nAnd in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.\n8\nAnd into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:\n9\nAnd heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\n10\nBut into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,\n11\nEven the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\n12\nBut I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for\nSodom\n, than for that city.\n13\nWoe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee,\nBethsaida\n! for if the mighty works had been done in\nTyre\nand\nSidon\n, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.\n14\nBut it shall be more tolerable for\nTyre\nand\nSidon\nat the judgment, than for you.\n15\nAnd thou,\nCapernaum\n, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.\n16\nHe that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.\n17\nAnd the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.\n18\nAnd he said unto them,\nI beheld\nSatan\nas lightning fall from heaven.\n19\nBehold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.\n20\nNotwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.\n21\nIn that hour\nJesus\nrejoiced in spirit, and said,\nI thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.\n22\nAll things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.\n23\nAnd he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,\nBlessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:\n24\nFor I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.\n25\nAnd, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\n26\nHe said unto him,\nWhat is written in the law? how readest thou?\n27\nAnd he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.\n28\nAnd he said unto him,\nThou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.\n29\nBut he, willing to justify himself, said unto\nJesus\n, And who is my neighbour?\n30\nAnd\nJesus\nanswering said,\nA certain man went down from\nJerusalem\nto\nJericho\n, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.\n31\nAnd by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.\n32\nAnd likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.\n33\nBut a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,\n34\nAnd went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.\n35\nAnd on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.\n36\nWhich now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?\n37\nAnd he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said\nJesus\nunto him,\nGo, and do thou likewise.\n38\nNow it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named\nMartha\nreceived him into her house.\n39\nAnd she had a sister called\nMary\n, which also sat at\nJesus\n' feet, and heard his word.\n40\nBut\nMartha\nwas cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.\n41\nAnd\nJesus\nanswered and said unto her,\nMartha\n,\nMartha\n, thou art careful and troubled about many things:\n42\nBut one thing is needful: and\nMary\nhath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\n\nLuke chapter 11 The good Samaritan\nW\nP\nMore Bibles\nAudio Bibles\nBible\n/\nKJV\nLuke\nChapter:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n-\nReset\n+\nChapter 11\n1\nAnd it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as\nJohn\nalso taught his disciples.\n2\nAnd he said unto them,\nWhen ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.\n3\nGive us day by day our daily bread.\n4\nAnd forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.\n5\nAnd he said unto them,\nWhich of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;\n6\nFor a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?\n7\nAnd he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.\n8\nI say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.\n9\nAnd I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\n10\nFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\n11\nIf a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?\n12\nOr if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?\n13\nIf ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?\n14\nAnd he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.\n15\nBut some of them said, He casteth out devils through\nBeelzebub\nthe chief of the devils.\n16\nAnd others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.\n17\nBut he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them,\nEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.\n18\nIf\nSatan\nalso be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through\nBeelzebub\n.\n19\nAnd if I by\nBeelzebub\ncast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.\n20\nBut if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.\n21\nWhen a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:\n22\nBut when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.\n23\nHe that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.\n24\nWhen the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.\n25\nAnd when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.\n26\nThen goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.\n27\nAnd it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.\n28\nBut he said,\nYea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.\n29\nAnd when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say,\nThis is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of\nJonas\nthe prophet.\n30\nFor as\nJonas\nwas a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.\n31\nThe queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of\nSolomon\n; and, behold, a greater than\nSolomon\nis here.\n32\nThe men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of\nJonas\n; and, behold, a greater than\nJonas\nis here.\n33\nNo man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.\n34\nThe light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.\n35\nTake heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.\n36\nIf thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.\n37\nAnd as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.\n38\nAnd when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.\n39\nAnd the Lord said unto him,\nNow do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.\n40\nYe fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?\n41\nBut rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.\n42\nBut woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.\n43\nWoe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.\n44\nWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.\n45\nThen answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.\n46\nAnd he said,\nWoe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.\n47\nWoe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.\n48\nTruly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.\n49\nTherefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:\n50\nThat the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;\n51\nFrom the blood of\nAbel\nunto the blood of\nZacharias\n, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.\n52\nWoe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.\n53\nAnd as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:\n54\nLaying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\n\nLuke chapter 12 The Wise servant\nW\nP\nMore Bibles\nAudio Bibles\nBible\n/\nKJV\nLuke\nChapter:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n-\nReset\n+\nChapter 12\n1\nIn the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all,\nBeware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.\n2\nFor there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.\n3\nTherefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.\n4\nAnd I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.\n5\nBut I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.\n6\nAre not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?\n7\nBut even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.\n19\nAnd I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\n20\nBut God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?\n21\nSo is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.\n22\nAnd he said unto his disciples,\nTherefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.\n23\nThe life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.\n24\nConsider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?\n25\nAnd which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?\n26\nIf ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?\n27\nConsider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that\nSolomon\nin all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\n28\nIf then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?\n29\nAnd seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.\n30\nFor all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.\n31\nBut rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.\n32\nFear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.\n33\nSell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.\n34\nFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n35\nLet your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;\n36\nAnd ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding;

and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\n15\nAnd they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.\n16\nBut\nJesus\ncalled them unto him, and said,\nSuffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\n17\nVerily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.\n18\nAnd a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\n19\nAnd\nJesus\nsaid unto him,\nWhy callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.\n20\nThou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.\n21\nAnd he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.\n22\nNow when\nJesus\nheard these things, he said unto him,\nYet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.\n23\nAnd when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.\n24\nAnd when\nJesus\nsaw that he was very sorrowful, he said,\nHow hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\n25\nFor it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\n26\nAnd they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?\n27\nAnd he said,\nThe things which are impossible with men are possible with God.\n28\nThen\nPeter\nsaid, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.\n29\nAnd he said unto them,\nVerily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,\n30\nWho shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.\n31\nThen he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them,\nBehold, we go up to\nJerusalem\n, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.\n32\nFor he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:\n33\nAnd they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.\n34\nAnd they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.\n35\nAnd it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto\nJericho\n, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:\n36\nAnd hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.\n37\nAnd they told him, that\nJesus\nof\nNazareth\npasseth by.\n38\nAnd he cried, saying,\nJesus\n, thou son of\nDavid\n, have mercy on me.\n39\nAnd they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of\nDavid\n, have mercy on me.\n40\nAnd\nJesus\nstood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,\n41\nSaying,\nWhat wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?\nAnd he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.\n42\nAnd\nJesus\nsaid unto him,\nReceive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.\n43\nAnd immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.\nCourtesy of Wordproject, a registered domain of\nInternational Biblical Association\n, a non-profit organization registered in Macau, China.\n\nLuke chapter 19 Jesus and Zacchaeus\nW\nP\nMore Bibles\nAudio Bibles\nBible\n/\nKJV\nLuke\nChapter:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n-\nReset\n+\nChapter 19\n1\nAnd\nJesus\nentered and passed through\nJericho\n.\n2\nAnd, behold, there was a man named\nZacchæus\n, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.\n3\nAnd he sought to see\nJesus\nwho he was;

I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.\n14\nBut when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.\n15\nSo they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.

and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.\n32\nLast of all the woman died also.\n33\nTherefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.\n34\nAnd\nJesus\nanswering said unto them,\nThe children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:\n35\nBut they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:\n36\nNeither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels;

Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.\n25\nAnd he said unto them,\nWhere is your faith?\nAnd they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.\n26\nAnd they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against\nGalilee\n.\n27\nAnd when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.\n28\nWhen he saw\nJesus\n, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee,\nJesus\n, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.\n29\n(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)\n30\nAnd\nJesus\nasked him, saying,\nWhat is thy name?\nAnd he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.\n31\nAnd they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.\n32\nAnd there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them.
